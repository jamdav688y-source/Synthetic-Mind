# Synthetic Mind

This repository is a living cognitive architecture.

It is not a software project.
It is not a notes folder.
It is not a demo.

It is a structured, evolving system for:

- Capturing how I think
- Encoding how I evaluate systems, decisions, and risks
- Turning judgment, frameworks, and governance into durable artifacts
- Building a public, compounding intellectual engine

This repo will contain:

- Canonical doctrines and principles
- Diagnostics and evaluation frameworks
- Decision systems and governance gates
- Research threads and thought experiments
- Consulting-grade methods and playbooks
- A growing “operating system” for reasoning about complex systems

Over time, this becomes:

- A personal cognitive OS
- A product and consulting substrate
- A public research lab
- A proof-of-work engine for how I think

The goal is simple:

> Turn a mind into an artifact that compounds.

Everything in this repository is designed to be:
- Legible
- Auditable
- Reusable
- Teachable
- And evolvable

This is the foundation.
