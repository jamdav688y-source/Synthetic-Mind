# 00 — Map: How to Read and Use This Repository

This repo is built like a mind.

If you only read one thing first, read this file.

---

## What this repo is
A structured system for:
- thinking clearly
- making judgment calls
- turning messy situations into clean decisions
- producing repeatable “artifacts” (documents you can use in real life)

---

## How to navigate (simple)
Start here:
- `README.md` → what this is
- `00-start-here/00-map.md` → how to use it

Then move in order:
- `01-doctrine/` → the rules (what the mind believes)
- `02-diagnostics/` → the tests (how it judges risk and truth)
- `03-artifacts/` → the outputs (what it produces)
- `10-architecture/` → how everything connects

---

## The rule of the repo
Nothing is “just an idea.”

If it matters, it becomes:
- a file
- a checklist
- a template
- or a decision record

---

## What you can do immediately
If you have a situation you need to judge:
1) Go to `02-diagnostics/`
2) Run it through the diagnostic
3) Output an artifact in `03-artifacts/`
